# Wish Matching App

The goal of the app is to set to implement a system where users can post items they want to give away, share their lists with other users, and receive recommendations based on location and category. When a match occurs, the chat function is automatically enabled to facilitate the transaction. Minimizing waste of resources and reducing consumer spending were set as the project's objectives through this app.
